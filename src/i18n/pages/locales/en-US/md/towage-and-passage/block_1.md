One of the core activities of our company is the Organization of Sea Towing, as well as the development of a Single Voyage Plan.

We specialize in the development, organization and coordination of all the required measures - both with the Classification Societies that supervise ships, and the Maritime Administrations, as well as the Port Authorities, for the following types of towing:

\- **planned towing** of a vessel - for example, the hull of a new vessel to the place of installation of the engine and equipment, a floating crane or a sailing vessel with a retracted boom or mast along inland waterways (rivers and canals with passage under bridges), moving a vessel from one water basin to another, outside the established navigation area.

\- **towing of a damaged vessel (floating object)** that has lost its speed or is deprived of the ability to navigate.

## The Standard Scope Of Services For The Development Of A Marine Towage Design Project Usually Includes:

1. Explanatory note indicating the characteristics and requirements for the technical state of the towed object, analysis of the requirements of regulatory documents applicable to this case, a description of the area and conditions of towage operation, measures to ensure the safety of towing (including measures of the environmental protection);
2. Selection of the optimal route, taking into account the distances from shelter sites, ports of refuge and GMDSS areas, as well as restrictions on permissible wind-wave characteristics during the towage operation;
3. Description of the navigational situation and weather conditions along the towing route;
4. Calculation of the safe speed and the required bollard pull for towing the vessel, as well as the calculation of the elements of the towing line;
5. Selection of a tug with optimal performance characteristics for towing purposes, in relation to the towing object;
6. Calculation of the forces acting on the towed object, taking into account the predicted weather conditions;
7. Calculations of strength, stability and freeboard for the towage area and conditions;
8. Drawings of the reinforcement of the hull and superstructures;
9. Drawings and diagrams of closing openings in the hull and superstructures of the vessel (converting), as well as installation of structures to increase seaworthiness (breakers, protection of superstructures, deckhouses);
10.   Scheme of the towing line, towage plan, fencing protection scheme;
11.   Drawings of the location of navigation lights and daytime signals of the towed vessel;
12.   Description of the power plant, electrical, radio and navigation equipment of towing vessels;
13.   Description of the steering, anchor, mooring devices, fire protection and equipment, rescue and signaling means on all ships of the tugboat;
14.   List of emergency supplies and a diagram of its placement on all ships of the tugboat;
15.   Instructions for the tug Master, including organizational measures, established weather restrictions, instructions on the safe speed and length of the tug, use of ship's stores, damage control of a vessel in emergency situations.
16.   Approval of the Marine Towage Design Project in the Classification Society;
17.   Approval of the Marine Towage Design Project in the Maritime Administration with the subsequent receipt of a Single-Voyage Towage Permission Certificate (if required).

## A competently done Marine Towage Design Project will ensure the safe delivery of the towed object from the port of departure to the port of destination, in which the towing vessels:

-  have information on permissible waves, wind forces, distances between ports of refuge; where the management of the risk of getting into unfavorable weather conditions - exceeding their capabilities - lies solely with the tug Master;
-  will not tear the tug, will not be pulled out of the deck and will not damage in any other way its anchorage points;
-  will not run the towed vessel aground or roll it over an obstacle;
-  will not be left without fuel, fresh water or food;
-  will be able to receive weather forecasts and navigation warnings;
-  will be able to contact the shore at any time to request information or assistance;
-  in case of worsening weather or an emergency situation on board, they will be able to safely reach the port of refuge.

## We are also ready to offer additional services to provide a turnkey complex through our partners, namely:

-  provision of suitable tugs for towing purposes;
-  organization of technical survey;
-  preparation of the floating craft for towing (converting);
-  presentation of the craft to the inspector of the Classification Society;
-  towage insurance.
